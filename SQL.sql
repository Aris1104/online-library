What\'s more, companies experience a set of predictable internal crises, at predictable stages, as they grow. Even for healthy companies, these crises, if not managed properly, stifle the ability to grow further - and can actively lead to decline.

Misfortune should not disturb the individual at all, and should not be perceived negatively. Epictetus teaches that the only genuine value exists in virtuous action and accepting everything that happens in the world. He believed that one should do what is right and remain indifferent to criticism. Epictetus was highly regarded by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the early Christian philosopher Origen, and the Neo-Platonist Simplicius of Cilicia, among others.

The teachings given here on the outlook and technique of meditation provide the foundation that every practitioner needs to awaken as the Buddha did. Trungpa teaches us to let go of the urge to make meditation serve our ambition; thus we can relax into openness. We are shown how the deliberate practice of mindfulness develops into contrived awareness, and we discover the world of insight that awareness reveals. We learn of a subtle psychological stage set that we carry with us everywhere and unwittingly use to structure all our experience - and we find that meditation gradually carries us beyond this and beyond ego altogether to the experience of unconditioned freedom.','-1'),(8498,'All About Passion: A Cynster Novel','Stephanie Laurens','-1',NULL,'Sorry, we just need to make sure you\'re not a robot.

In this pithy, liberating, and delightful book she gives us a fresh, new view of learning in the broadest sense.

Jack invents an imaginary brother, Ernest, whom he uses as an excuse to escape from his dull country home and gallivant in town. Meanwhile, Algernon follows Jack\'s scam, but his imaginary friend, Bumbury, provides a convenient method of adventuring in the country. However, their deceptions eventually cross paths, resulting in a series of crises that threaten to spoil their romantic pursuits. Hailed as the first modern comedy in England, The Importance of Being Earnest is Wilde\'s most famous work. ','-1'),(8605,'Bringers of the Dawn: Teachings from the Plei','Barbara Marciniak','-1',NULL,'\nBy completing your purchase you agree to Audible’s  Conditions of Use, Amazon\'s Privacy Notice and if applicable Audible\'s Recurring Payment Terms.\n','-1'),(8606,'God\'s Crime Scene: A Cold-Case Detective Exam','J.

Men and women did not always cower behind protective magical wards and hope to see the dawn. Once, they battled the demons on equal terms, but those days, and skills, are gone. Arlen Bales lives with his parents on their isolated farmstead until a demon attack shatters their world. He learns a savage lesson that day: that people, as well as magic, can let you down.

The creative and technical logistics that go into building today\'s hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Jason Schreier takes readers on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius. Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-sized monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisypheanâ€”it\'s nothing short of miraculous.Taking some of the most popular, bestselling recent games, Schreier immerses readers in the hellfire of the development process, whether it\'s RPG studio Bioware\'s challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build Dragon Age: Inquisition; indie developer Eric Barone\'s single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG Stardew Valley from one man\'s vision into a multi-million-dollar franchise; or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create Destiny, a brand new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as Star Wars and Lord of the Ringsâ€”even as it nearly ripped their studio apart. Documenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels is a journey through development hellâ€”and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable.','Games &amp, Activities , Video &amp, Electronic',9780060000000,'English',''),('9','Twas The Nightshift Before Christmas: Festive hospital diaries from the author of million-copy hit This is Going to Hurt','Adam Kay','A short gift book of festive hospital diaries from the author of million-copy bestseller This is Going to HurtChristmas is coming, the goose is getting fat . . . but 1.4 million NHS staff are heading off to work.

A serial killer is out there, his frequency increasing, and they know there is only one agent good enough to crack this case: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley is on paid leave herself, recovering from her encounter with her last serial killer, and, fragile as she is, the FBI is reluctant to tap her brilliant mind. Yet Riley, needing to battle her own demons, comes on board, and her hunt leads her through the disturbing subculture of doll collectors, into the homes of broken families, and into the darkest canals of the killerâ€™s mind. As Riley peels back the layers, she realizes she is up against a killer more twisted than she could have imagined. In ONCE TAKEN, women are being murdered in upstate New York, their bodies found mysteriously hanging in chains. With the FBI called in, given the bizarre nature of the murdersâ€”and the lack of any cluesâ€”there is only one agent they can turn to: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley, reeling from her last case, is reluctant to take on a new one, since she is still convinced a former serial killer is out there, stalking her. She knows, though, that her ability to enter a serial killerâ€™s mind and her obsessive nature is what will be needed to crack this case, and she just canâ€™t refuseâ€”even if it will push her over the edge. Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the Riley Paige mysteries are a riveting new seriesâ€”with a beloved new characterâ€”that will leave you turning pages late into the night. Book #3 in the series, ONCE CRAVED, is now also available.','none',9781630000000,'English',''),('13','Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe','Cullen Bunn','Collects Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe #1-4.
